The Raft paper suggests it to be a magnitude greater than heartbeatRTT, which is the interval between two heartbeats.

| raft.maxSendQueueSize | int | `0` | maxSendQueueSize is the maximum size in bytes of each send queue. Once the maximum size is reached,   further replication messages will be dropped to restrict memory usage.   When set to 0, it means the send queue size is unlimited. |

| raft.rtt | string | `"50ms"` | rtt: Defines the average Round Trip Time (RTT) between two NodeHost instances.   Such an RTT interval is internally used as a logical clock tick, Raft heartbeat and election intervals   are both defined in terms of how many such RTT intervals. Note that RTTMillisecond is the combined delays   between two NodeHost instances including all delays caused by network transmission,   delays caused by NodeHost queuing and processing.   Specified as Go's duration string (https://pkg.go.dev/maze.io/x/duration#ParseDuration). |
